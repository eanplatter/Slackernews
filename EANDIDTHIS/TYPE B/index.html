<!-- This is where you will have your applications hub. It is typically the only file that needs to do things like declare HTML5: 
	<!DOCTYPE html>

heads and bodies 
	<head></head>, 
		<body></body>

and with AngularJS, it's where you'll call your views: 
	<div ng-view></div>


You will also need to link all of your files and third party code. 


Within the <head></head> we want to place our stylesheets and, later on, meta tags. 

At the bottom of our <body></body> we will place all of our <script></script> files. 

With <script></script> files we list them from the most independent files to the least. 

For instance:
	Firebase's AngularFire wont work unless we have AngularJS above it in our body.
	This is because our app will go and search for AngularFire, and THEN search for Angular.
	When this happens, AngularFire will say, "WTF there is no Angular here!" and Angular will say
	"I don't see AngularFire! Why is the module calling AngularFire!?"

It's a freaking mess.  


One last thing you'll need to include in the index is your <div ng-view></div>. This essentially
looks at your router, and at the URL and says, what do I need to show. The router should never show the index.html, if you do this, your browser will crash. This is becaue the router will say: LOOK TO INDEX.HTML, so then your app does, and when it gets there index.html says: LOOK TO THE ROUTES. Infinite. Freaking. Loop.
